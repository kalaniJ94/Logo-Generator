# Logo-Generator

## Description

This challenge was an interesting look into the power of node, and a brand new concept in SVG. 

Testing is an interesting challenge, and one that I look forward to expanding my knowledge on in the future. I need alot of polishing in this area, but it's usefulness and applications are obvious. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

1. Upon opening the app, check to make sure you have a package.json file on the lefthand side. If not, open the terminal and type "npm init -y". 
2. Still in the terminal, type " npm i". This will install all necessary node packages. Check to make sure your dependancies list matches this: 
"dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.1.3",
    "fs": "^0.0.1-security",
    "inquirer": "^8.2.4",
    "jest": "^29.6.4",
    "jsdom": "^22.1.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "svg-parser": "^2.0.4"
  }


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
![Screenshot 1 shows the open terminal with running command.](assets/Screenshot1.png)
![Screenshot 2 shows a completed app run, with the expected message.](assets/Screenshot2.png)
![Screenshot 3 shows the updated logo.html file in vs code](assets/Screenshot3.png)
![Screenshot 4 shows the logo displaying in the browser](assets/Screenshot4.png)
